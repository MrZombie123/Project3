to play the game you use the WASD keys to move around SPACE to jump E to interact with trashie devicies (i think?) and ESC on the title screen to exit the game.

you goal is to get to the final biomechnical jumppad and get eaten off screen, be carefull, because falling down is instadeath!

treverse that bacon carefully!

thats it for me see you later and as always HAVE FUN!
